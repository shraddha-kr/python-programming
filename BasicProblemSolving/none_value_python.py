'''
Note: 
None is distinct from 0 (zero), False (zero),
 and an empty string. It is a distinct data 
 type (NoneType), and only None is capable of 
 being None.  None is an instance of the NoneType 
 object type. And it is a particular variable that 
 has no objective value. While new NoneType objects 
 cannot be generated,
 None can be assigned to any variable.
 Undefined variables and Nonetype variables are totally different. No variable is Nonetype until it is explicitly defined as None.
None is a Singleton object.
Comparing None to anything will always return False except None itself.
=None can not be overwritten, not even as a class attribute or in the confines of a function.
None is used as both a flag and a valid value.
